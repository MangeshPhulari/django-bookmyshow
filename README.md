[![Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Render-Deployed-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=render)](https://bookmyshow-web-e71k.onrender.com/)

**Live Project URL:** [**https://bookmyshow-web-e71k.onrender.com/**](https://bookmyshow-web-e71k.onrender.com/)

A comprehensive clone of the popular BookMyShow website, built from scratch with Python and Django. This application provides a full end-to-end user experience, from browsing movies and selecting seats to processing payments and receiving email confirmations.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Production Deployment & Challenges Solved

This project was successfully deployed to **Render**. The transition from `DEBUG=True` (local) to `DEBUG=False` (production) introduced several major challenges that were systematically debugged and resolved.

### 1. Static & Media Files
* **Static Files (CSS/JS):** `Whitenoise` was implemented to serve static files collected by `collectstatic`.
* **Media Files (Images):** `django-cloudinary-storage` was configured. The key challenge was that standard `model.save()` calls were failing to upload images silently.
    * **Solution:** A direct upload workaround was implemented in `movies/admin.py` and `users/views.py`. This code uses `cloudinary.uploader.upload()` to force the upload and then manually saves the correct Cloudinary path (e.g., `profile_pics/image.png`) to the database using `queryset.update()`, bypassing the default save method's conflict.

### 2. 500 Server Errors
* **Problem:** The live site would crash with 500 errors on the homepage and movie detail pages.
* **Solution:** The error was traced to the `{% cloudinary_url %}` tag. It was crashing when trying to render an object that had no image (`movie.image.name` was `None`). This was fixed by adding `{% if movie.image and movie.image.name %}` checks in all templates (`home.html`, `movie_detail.html`, `profile.html`) to safely handle movies or profiles without images.

### 3. Email Confirmation Failures
* **Problem:** After booking, the app would crash with a 500 error due to a timeout from the Gmail SMTP server.
* **Solution:** The email backend was migrated to **SendGrid**.
    * This still resulted in a `403 Forbidden` error from the SendGrid API.
    * Logs showed the error: `"The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity."`
    * **Final Fix:** The `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` address was verified in the SendGrid dashboard, and `movies/email_utils.py` was updated to explicitly use `from_email=settings.SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` in the `send_mail` function. This resolved all email errors.

## üìß Booking Confirmation Note

When you successfully book a ticket, the system will send a confirmation email via SendGrid.

**Please note:** If you do not see the email in your inbox within a few minutes, **please check your Spam or Junk folder.**
